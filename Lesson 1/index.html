    <p>
      Good morning one and all present here. I am standing before you all to
      share my thoughts through my speech about life. <br />
      Life is a continuous ongoing process that has to end someday. <br />
      Life is all about adoring yourself, creating yourself. A quote for you
      that life can be only understood backward but it must be lived forwards.
      <br />Life itself is a golden opportunity to live a meaningful life and
      support others to do so. It doesn`t matter how many years you live. But it
      matters how well you live a quality life.
